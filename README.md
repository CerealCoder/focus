# Milky Front-end Starter Kit

Milky is the Front-end started kit I created for myself after finding that I was spending too much time setting up projects.

It is opinionated as I am a massive fan of indented sass over scss, and my libraries of choice are bourbon and neat (sorry compass fans)

I also incorporated the Jade templating engine because I find it more enjoyable and fun for writing markup (also it's beautiful and easy to read)

It also comes packed with smoothie, my sass animation library. I was thinking about doing a Jekyll version of it but I abandoned the idea.

As of december 2015, Milky is fully compatible with javascript es6 (or ES2015) thanks to babel and browserify. This will enable you (and me) to write modular and easy to manage javascript code.

All you have to do is browse to the /dev folder, run (sudo) npm install and gulp.

Everything will be outputed to the /public folder.

It also comes with browser sync, which is a very useful tool that reloads the browser after every change you make to your development files.

I suck at writing documentation so feel free to correct me if you stumble upon this and find things that could be improved.

Have fun coding :)
